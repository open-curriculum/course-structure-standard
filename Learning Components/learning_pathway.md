# Learning Pathway

A learning pathway is a series of linked learning components that form a body of study. Predefined pathways are often linear, whereas self-directed pathways take the form of branches or recursive loops. Tangential pathways will emerge from an abundance of related content, allowing learners to alter their learning trajectory in real-time.
