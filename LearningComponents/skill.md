# Skill
A skill is an ability, often taught with increasing difficultly over time. A learner's capability is comprised of a skill or set of skills combined with experience or knowledge. Some skills are connected to long-term learning outcomes and are not exploited until later in the learning process.

A skill is traditionally not thought of as valuable outside of the context of it's traditional field of practice. As problems gain in complexity, they require a broader set of solutions from multiple disciplines. This is why many disciplines are seemingly fluid, merging with other disciplines over time. When a skill of one discipline is applied within another discipline, this is known as cross-disciplinary (I.E. - A biologist who uses standard lab equipment and techniques to create art). This is closely related to intradisciplinary, interdsciplinary, transdisciplinary, multidisciplinary.
