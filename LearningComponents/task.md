# Task
If a pedagogy is [compromised of things that a learner can do](http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/4483), then we can consider a ***task*** (something one does) to be one of the most fundamental components of learning. Depending on the learning model, the tasks may be explicitly described by an instructor, or they may be identified and completed by the learner. Thus, a task may be both the action one takes to learn and the action one takes to demonstrate learning has happened. 
## Types
Tasks can include:
- answering
- reviewing
- evaluating
- interviewing

- recording
- writing
