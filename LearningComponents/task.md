# Task
If a pedagogy is [compromised of things that a learner can do](http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/4483), then we can consider a ***task*** (something one does) to be one of the most fundamental components of learning. Depending on the learning model, the tasks may be explicitly described by an instructor, or they may be identified and completed by the learner. Thus, a task may be both the action one takes to learn **and** the action one takes to demonstrate learning has happened. 

A task can therefore be both an assignment and an assessment. While there are no types of assignments where no task is involved, there are many types of assessments requiring no task by the learner be completed.

## Types
Tasks can include:
- answering
- reviewing
- analyzing
- experimenting
- evaluating
- interviewing
- reflecting
- recording
- writing
- watching
- listening
- attending
- drawing
- sketching
- defining 
- solving
- discussing
- presenting
- completing
- making
- performing
- etc.


## Example Usage
**Task 1 (Assignment):** *A student practices multiplication with a multiplication activity worksheet.* This worksheet is not assessed, but provides a structured way for a student to learn through repetition.

**Task 2 (Assessment):** *A student must take a multiplication quiz.* This enables the student to demonstrate that they learned the skill of multiplication in a way that an instructor is able to perceive.

**Task 3 (Tangential):** Attending a lecture by a prominent expert in a relevant field. While this task may contribute to learning, an instructor may not be able to directly assess if any learning happened, nor could they predict what learning will happen. In this case, the onus of gleaning relevance is up to the learner.
