# Open Education Standard: Courses

Version: 2016-02-15

## Status of this Memo

This document defines what standard components make up a course and how they are defined and utilized per an open community of educators. Contribution to this document is encouraged and distribution of this document is unlimited.

## Abstract

Academic courses in K-12 and higher education, alike, are composed of similar pieces and serve a similar purpose in education. Not all parts of a course are applicable to every course and can be designated as an optional component. The lexicon used from academic organization to academic organization can change drastically as do the base requirements of a course. While requirements by the organization are unique, the terminology and structure of the course can be made standard while not impeding the goals and unique characteristics of the course.
