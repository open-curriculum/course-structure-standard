# Open Course Structure Standards
Version: 2016-02-15

### Status of this Memo
This document defines what standard components make up a course and how they are defined and utilized per an open community of educators. Contribution to this document is encouraged and distribution of this document is unlimited.

### Abstract
Academic courses in K-12 and higher education, alike, are composed of similar pieces and serve a similar purpose in education. Not all parts of a course are applicable to every course and can be designated as an *optional* component. The lexicon used from academic organization to academic organization can change drastically as do the base requirements of a course. While requirements by the organization are unique, the terminology and structure of the course can be made standard while not impeding the goals and unique characteristics of the course.
